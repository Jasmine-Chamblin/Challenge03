# Challenge03
Challenge assigment:
Challenge number 3 required us to create a random password generator based on parameters that the user confirms or specifies. Specifically, users needed to confirm whether or not they are okay with using upper and lowercase letters, if they are okay with using special characters and they needed to specific a password length between 8-128 characters. 
User experience:
The ideal goal is to have user answer a series of preferences related to a generated password. Once they answer the series of password preferences, users should see a generated password based on their specifications.
